# IoT based Automated Mushroom Cultivation System
## Introduction
Different mushroom needs different types of environments. Now you can create the environment as the mushroom needs. The system is so intelligent that it will automatically realize how to take care of mushrooms. When it is time to spray water or when it is time to provide fresh air and remove carbon-di-oxide. The system will notify after taking each action. A farmer doesn’t need to put hand on it. The system can maintain proper balance of humidity, temperature, light, carbon-di-oxide, oxygen and compost moisture for different mushrooms. Farmers can monitor the cultivation process remotely.
The project includes three-way control system :
1. Remote manual control.
2. Time based control.
3. Sensor based control.
## To complete the project I have used the following equipments :
1.  Arduino
2.  Intel Edison
3.  DHT11 
4.  LDR
5.  MQ-135 
6.  Soil Moisture Sensor
7.  RTC Module
8.  ESP8266
9.  Registor : 1K, 2.2K
10. 2 Relay module
11. Solenoid valve
12. Exhasut fan
13. Pipe and nozzles
## Technology
1. NodeJs
2. ReSTful API
3. Php
4. MySQL
5. Embedded C
6. JSON
7. Linux/Windows Server
8. MQTT
9. Socket
10. Javascript 
## Benefits
1. Real time information from multiple locations.
2. Automated System.	
3. Labour Cost reduction.
4. High accuracy in data recording.
5. Resource Optimization.
6. Increase the level of productivity. 
7. Intelligent Management of the mushroom cultivation process.
8. Compliance report for regulatory authority.
